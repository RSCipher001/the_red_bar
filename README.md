# The Red Bar
An AI powered command line tool

## Description
The red bar is supposed to be a neural network to understand instructions in written in human lanaguage and generate accurate command and optionally run them

## Goals
- Automating simple tasks like generating a nginx config and stuff like that, Most probably it will use hardcoded programming and ML both at it's core, Ansible is my primary choice to fallback for now.
